Itinero Data Processor
======================

IDP is a simple tool that exposes some of Itinero's functionality to act as a CLI tool to process routing data.

Basic supported features are:

- Reading/writing OSM-XML (.osm).
- Reading/writing OSM-PBF (.osm.pbf).
- Creating routable shapefiles based on OSM-data.

Everything IDP can, you can also do by writing code and using OsmSharp and Itinero but this tool allows you to setup regular update processes for example.

## Documentation

All relevant documentation is on the [wiki](https://github.com/itinero/idp/wiki). Only the features documented there are supported.
